Demo spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NcDE9dR1YECh28jClgteJtLSgtU4_OH4CLAt2epdGU/edit#gid=0

(demo was that upon running the container, emails with domains that aren't helpfulengineering.org get a red background, and last updated time cell gets a new value)

In terms of setup, I needed to enable the gdrive and gsheet APIs and create a service account credential.  The spreadsheet was then shared with the email of that service account.
